# Tools used & use cases:
I only used ChatGPT and Codex, both from OpenAI.
I used it for the following puroses:
- Code generation: Only for the media queries and dark mode toggle.
- Documentation Support: I wrote the initial bare-bones technical documentation, and asked simply asked codex to improve it.
- Debugging: For alignment of elements when they were misalligned

# Benefits & Challenges:
Benefits: Saved a lot of my time and frustration
Challenges: But it caused frustration because its code is too much!

# Learning Outcomes:
I mostly learned about media queries and the average different sizes for phones, tablets, computers

# How you modified AI suggestions responsibly:
I tried to make AI do the media queries completely. but it didn't work. I had to manually put in the styles of the elements I wanted to change depending on screen size. but I kept what it did with the media query sizes themselves.
